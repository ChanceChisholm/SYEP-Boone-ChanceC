Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”

BURR
There would have been nothin’ left to do
for someone less astute,
he woulda been dead or destitute
without a cent of restitution,
started workin’, clerkin’ for his late mother’s
landlord,
tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he
can’t afford
scammin’ for every book he can get his hands on,
plannin’ for the future see him now as he stands on
the bow of a ship headed for a new land,
In New York you can be a new man.
